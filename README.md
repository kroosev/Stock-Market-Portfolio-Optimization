# Stock-Market-Portfolio-Optimization
Stock market portfolio optimization is the process of selecting the best combination of stocks to maximize returns while minimizing the risk, based on historical performance data and financial metrics. Here, I optimize a stock market portfolio by analyzing the stock market performance using python. 
Stock market portfolio optimization involves analyzing price trends, calculating expected returns and volatilities, and determining the correlations between different stocks to achieve diversification. Using techniques such as Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), we can construct an efficient portfolio that relies on the efficient frontier to represent the optimal trade-off between risk and return. The expected results from stock market portfolio optimization include identifying the portfolio with the highest Sharpe ratio, which indicates the best risk-adjusted return and provides a clear allocation strategy for the selected stocks to achieve long-term investment goals. To get started with stock market portfolio optimization, we need to collect data about the stock market performance over time. I will collect real-time stock market data using the yfinance API.
First, I collected the stock market data of some popular Indian companies.
Next, plotted the stock market performance of these companies in the stock market over time. The graph displays the adjusted close prices of four stocks (HDFCBANK.NS, INFY.NS, RELIANCE.NS, TCS.NS) over time from July 2023 to July 2024. It highlights that TCS has the highest adjusted close prices, followed by RELIANCE, INFY (Infosys), and HDFCBANK. The prices for RELIANCE and TCS show noticeable upward trends, which indicates strong performance, while HDFCBANK and INFY exhibit more stability with relatively lower price fluctuations.
Next, computed the 50-day and 200-day moving averages and plotted these along with the Adjusted Close price for each stock. For HDFCBANK and INFY, the prices initially decline but later show signs of recovery, as indicated by the moving averages. RELIANCE and TCS display a more consistent upward trend in their adjusted close prices. The volume traded graphs highlight significant trading activity at various points, with spikes indicating high trading volumes, particularly noticeable in HDFCBANK and RELIANCE around early 2024. These insights are crucial for understanding price movements and trading behaviours, which assist in making informed investment decisions.
Next, the distribution of daily returns of these stocks is plotted. The distributions are approximately normal, centred around zero, which indicates that most daily returns are close to the average return. However, there are tails on both sides, which reflect occasional significant gains or losses. INFY and RELIANCE appear to have slightly wider distributions, which suggests higher volatility compared to HDFCBANK and TCS.
Next, the correlation between all these stocks is plotted.INFY and TCS have a high positive correlation (0.71), which indicates that they tend to move in the same direction. HDFCBANK has a moderate positive correlation with RELIANCE (0.37) and a low correlation with INFY (0.17) and TCS (0.10). RELIANCE shows a low correlation with INFY (0.19) and TCS (0.13). These varying correlations suggest potential diversification benefits; combining stocks with lower correlations can reduce overall portfolio risk.
Now, using Modern Portfolio Theory, I constructed an efficient portfolio by balancing risk and return by calculating the expected returns and volatility for each stock, Generating a series of random portfolios to identify the efficient frontier and optimize the portfolio to maximize the Sharpe ratio, which is a measure of risk-adjusted return.
First the expected returns and volatility for each stock is calculated. ELIANCE has the highest expected return (29.73%) and moderate volatility (21.47%), which indicates a potentially high-reward investment with relatively higher risk. INFY and TCS also have high expected returns (21.38% and 22.09% respectively) with moderate volatility (23.23% and 19.69%). HDFCBANK has the lowest expected return (1.37%) and moderate volatility (20.69%), which makes it the least attractive in terms of risk-adjusted returns.
Next, generated the random portfolios and plotted the efficient frontier. Each dot represents a portfolio, with the colour indicating the Sharpe ratio, a measure of risk-adjusted return. Portfolios on the leftmost edge of the frontier (closer to the y-axis) offer the highest expected returns for a given level of volatility, which represent optimal portfolios. The gradient shows that portfolios with higher Sharpe ratios (darker blue) provide better risk-adjusted returns.
Next, identified the portfolio with the maximum Sharpe ratio. The portfolio with the maximum Sharpe ratio has the following characteristics:

Expected Return: ~26.08%
Volatility: ~15.54%
Sharpe Ratio: ~1.68
Next, identified the weights of the stocks in the portfolio that yield the maximum Sharpe ratio. The output shows a diversified portfolio with the following allocations:

HDFCBANK (30.85%)
INFY (10.59%)
RELIANCE (18.02%)
and TCS (40.53%).
TCS has the highest allocation, which indicates its significant contribution to the portfolioâ€™s performance, while INFY has the smallest allocation. This balanced allocation aims to maximize returns while minimizing risk by leveraging individual stock performances and their correlations.

In summary, Stock market portfolio optimization involves analyzing price trends, calculating expected returns and volatilities, and determining the correlations between different stocks to achieve diversification.
